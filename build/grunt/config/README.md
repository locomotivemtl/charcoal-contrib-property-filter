Charcoal Admin Grunt Tasks
==========================

In development, assets should be copied or compiled into [`assets/dist/`](assets/dist).
In production, assets should be copied from [`assets/dist/`](assets/dist) into your project's public root (e.g., `../../../www/assets/admin`).

## Tasks

* `grunt default`
  1. Copy third-party assets from packages in `node_modules/` (NPM) and `vendor/` (Composer)
  2. Compile scripts, styles, and SVG images from `assets/src/`
  3. Minify all assets
  4. Copy freshly-processed assets to the public directory
* `grunt sync`
  1. Watch for changes in `assets/src/` and compile assets
  2. Watch for changes in `assets/dist/` and copy to the public directory
* `grunt deploy`
  1. Copy previously-processed assets to the public directory
